# HO-ResNet
A ResBlock Library using various High Order Numerical Schemes

Based on The Baseline ResBlock which could be regarded as Euler Forward Scheme.

Midpoint, Improved Euler, RK2, RK3, Heun3, RK4, Gill4, Kutta-Nystorm5(6), Huta6, Verner's RK-8 (fixed version) are provided.

A fixed version Verner's RK8 provided, RKFehlberg unfinished.
